📘 NumPy — Basics, Real-World Examples, and Mini Projects

This folder contains practical, beginner-friendly, and real-world examples of using NumPy, the most popular numerical computing library in Python.
Each section includes simple snippets, realistic use cases, and small projects to help you understand NumPy deeply.

🔰 1. Basic Examples

These scripts cover the fundamental operations every Python developer must know before doing data science or machine learning.

✔ array_creation.py

Learn how to create:

1D / 2D arrays

zeros, ones, random arrays

arange() and linspace()

✔ operations.py

Covers:

element-wise operations

broadcasting

dot product

scalar math

✔ reshape.py

Shows how to:

reshape arrays

flatten arrays

work with 3D tensors

✔ statistics.py

Learn common statistical methods:

mean, median, std

min/max

axis-wise statistics

🌍 2. Real-World Examples

These scripts demonstrate how NumPy is used in actual applications like data science, image processing, and ML.

✔ image_grayscale.py

Convert any RGB image to grayscale using NumPy operations.

✔ remove_outliers.py

Detect and remove outliers using mean & standard deviation.

✔ matrix_multiplication.py

Simulate a simple neural network forward-pass using matrix multiplication (XW).

🚀 3. Mini Projects

Small but practical projects showing NumPy’s power.

✔ numpy_vs_python_speed.py

Compare pure Python vs NumPy in processing 1,000,000 elements.
Demonstrates why NumPy is important for performance.

✔ fake_dataset_generator.py

Generate a synthetic dataset (age, salary, rating) and export it as CSV.
Useful for ML training and testing.
